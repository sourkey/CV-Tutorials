# Image Processing and Machine Vision Notes

## Introduction
The purpose of this group of files is to document concepts in Python image processing and machine vision in one location. A PDF and Jupyter Notebook is presented for each topic. The Jupyter Notebook allows the ability to follow through the presented concept. Machine vision is a more open ended topic but it builds on the work done in image processing. 

## Packages Used
 - PILLOW (PIL)
 - SCIKIT-IMAGE (skimage)
 - PYTESSERACT (pytesseract)

## Image Files

Images were downloaded from the USC Signal and Imaging Institute website. They are used for demonstration purposes only.
